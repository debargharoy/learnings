# Object

- A bundled unit of state and behavior. 
- Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.
- Instance of a class

## Benefits
- Modularity
- Data abstraction 
- Code re-use
- Pluggability and ease of debugging

# Class

- A blueprint/prototype to create objects. 

# Inheritence 

- Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software
- Allows inheriting commonly used state and behavior from other class

# Interface

- A contract between a class and outside world. 
- A class implementing the interface promises to support the behaviours defined by the interface. 

# Package

- Namespace to organize class and interface in a logical manner.
