  * Compile-time and deployment-time processing - generating code, spec files, etc
  * Runtime processing - like spring annotations

* Retntion Policies 
  * SOURCE - only in source code
  * CLASS - available at compile time
  * RUNTIME - retained by the JVM for runtime use

* `@Inherited` enables annotation to be inherited from super class. Not true by default.
* `@Repeatable` - for multiple same annotations
* Repeating annotations are stored in a container annotation automatically generated by the Java compiler (for compatibility reasons).
* Mark a annotation with `@Repeatable(ContainerAnnotation.class)` to make it repeatable.
